Library and utilities to develop protocols and check for protocol compliance in medical imaging.

We use the term "protocol" here loosely, to refer to MRI acquisition protocols, or neuroimaging data QC protocols, or MRI system QA protocols etc.


Features
--------

 - simple tool to check for *protocol compliance* : ensure all subjects in a given dataset were acquired with same/compatible values for few key parameters.
 - to come: full-fledged protocol compliance! based on EXAR files, check the entire protocol for all subjects in a given dataset
