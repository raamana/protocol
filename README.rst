Current release focuses on MRI image acquisition protocols for QA purposes only.

 - simple tool to check for *protocol compliance* :
    ensure all subjects in a given dataset were acquired with same/compatible values for few key parameters.
 - programmatic parsing of Siemens protocols in XML format
